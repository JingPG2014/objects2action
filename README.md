This repository is an implementation of "Objects2action: Classifying and localizing actions without any video example". 

This repo is not the original implementation of the related paper.

The code needs word vectors of actions and also object scores and these are provided by the authors. You can check out the web page of Objectsaction project (https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.jain/projects/Objects2action.html) to obtain these data.
